% About me
{\large\textbf{\textcolor{sectiongray}{About Me}}}\\[-0.2cm]
\noindent
I started programming in college with JavaScript, focusing on frontend development. As the market shifted toward highly specialized frontend roles, I realized I was more interested in solving backend problems than doing visual design, so I transitioned to backend development. Since then, I’ve been following the Boot.dev curriculum and built a Python project that finds similarities in text using sentence transformers, and a Go capstone project that fetches financial assets and analyzes them to identify outliers.

\textbf{BlightSanest} \hfill \textit{Go, RabbitMQ, Docker}\\
I started building BlightSanest as the Boot.dev capstone project but it turned into something I will never stop building. It's a CLI financial analysis program, I built it in a way that helps me do something I don't really like -investments- in a way I enjoy -looking into how things change with different parameters-.
I built this app with two sides, server and client to give users as much as power on the data without being a burden to the 3rd party APIs. So, I chose RabbitMQ to implement a publisher/subscriber architecture and coded the app with Go.
