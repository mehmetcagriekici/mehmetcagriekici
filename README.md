  <h1>⚡ Heed the Call ⚡</h1>
  <h3>I am Çağrı (The Call) - Summoner of Code, Weaver of Logic</h3>
</div>

## ✨ Arcane Origins

I'm Çağrı, from Turkey, where my name literally means "the call". Since July 2025, I've been answering that call through backend development. I believe the best projects are born from frustration - I build solutions for tasks I don't enjoy, transforming them into problems worth solving. Boot.dev is where I sharpen my craft.

## ⚔️ Legendary Quests

### 🏰 [BlightSanest](https://github.com/mehmetcagriekici/blightsanest)
*Go • RabbitMQ • Docker*

A CLI tool for fetching and analyzing finance assets to identify outliers. Built with a publisher/subscriber architecture that separates data from functionality - the server fetches raw data and publishes to clients, enabling simultaneous analysis of any finance asset across multiple terminals.

### 🗡️ [ReArgs](https://github.com/mehmetcagriekici/reargs)
*Python • Sentence Transformers*

A command-line tool that analyzes .txt files for semantic repetitions and similarities. It doesn't rewrite your text—it helps you visualize and organize your writing by highlighting repetitions and grouping similar content using NLP.
